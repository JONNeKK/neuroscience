The process by which the neural tube is formed and acquires increasingly complex morphology is referred to as neurulation.
# primary neurulation
The neural plate rolls up into itself and grows to form the neural tube, a hollow structure which develops into the central canal to form ventricles in the brain.

# secondary neurulation
More posteriori. This is the continuation of the neural tube, bute not formed from the neural plate.

# what goes where
The anterior part of the neural tube forms the forebrain, the midbrain and the hindbrain. The posterior part of the neural tube forms the spinal cord.





# Flashcards
What is primary neurulation? :: The folding of the neural plate into itself.
What is secondary neurulation? :: The formation of a neural tube by a preformed rod
What parts are later formed of the primary neurulation? :: fore- mid- and hindbrain
What parts are later formed of the secondary neurulation? :: the spinal cord
