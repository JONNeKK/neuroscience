###### What it is
The potential where the effect of concentration and electrical [[7-notes/knowledge/membrane potential\|membrane potential]]difference cancel each other out. Therefore there is no movement of ions across the membrane and the net current through [[7-notes/knowledge/ion channel\|ion channel]]s is 0.


###### factors affecting the equilibrium potential (ep) for potassium
- higher concentration difference → ep is more negative
- smaller concentration difference → ep is closer to 0
- no concentration difference → ep is 0
- reverse concentration difference → ep is positive
For other ions the signs might change

The equilibrium potential can be calculated with the [[7-notes/knowledge/nernst equation\|nernst equation]].
