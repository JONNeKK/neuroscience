There are a number of different receptors:
# Mechanoreceptors
They sense physical deformation of neurites. This can be caused by different things:
- pressure
- stretch
- motion
- sound
For the sense of touch in mammals these are dendrites of sensory neurons. 
# Peripheral sensors

### properties
Sensor properties are defined by accessory structures:
- Meissner's corpuscles: specialized nerve endings in the skin (particularly fingertips and lips); detecting light touch and low-frequency vibrations
- Merkel discs: tactile sensory receptors in the epidermis and hair follicles; Sense pressure and texture discrimination
- Pacinian corpuscles: onion-like, deep in the skin; sense deep pressure and high-frequency vibrations
- Ruffini endings: in the dermis of the skin; detect skin stretch and deformation
- Free nerve endings: nerve ending in skin, organs, joints, ...; sense of temperature, pain and pressure
# proprioceptors
They sense internal mechanical signals (e.g. stretch and force in muscles, pressure in joints, tension in tendons, etc..)
# Receptor dynamics

### stimulus duration:
There are two classes of receptors:
- phasic receptors: produces [[7-notes/knowledge/action potential\|APs]] only when there is a change in stimulus
- tonic receptors: produces APs as long as the stimulus continues, but frequency decreases when stimulus is maintained for long periods
â†’ There are combinations of those
