# Fitt's law

<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">




$
T=a+b\log_{2}\left( \frac{2A}{W} \right).
$
- $T$: movement time
- $A$: movement amplitude
- $W$: target width

→ speed-accuracy trade-off

- The required endpoint accuracy is given by the target width $W$
- For a given constraint on endpoint accuracy, signal-dependent noise places a lower limit on movement duration
- Minimize movement duration for a given endpoint accuracy

# hand path and velocity profile
Basically straight movement paths have bell-shaped hand speed profiles. 
# Two-thirds power law
$$
\omega \sim \kappa^{2/3}.
$$
- $\omega$: angular velocity
- $\kappa$: curvature
→ movements are slower when the curvature is higher.


# Flashcards
What is Fitt's law? :: $T=a+b\log_{2}\left( \frac{2A}{W} \right)$. Describes a speed-accuracy trade-off and minimizes movement duration for a given endpoint accuracy
What speed profile have linear movement paths? :: bell shaped
What is the two-thirds power law? :: $\omega \sim \kappa^{2/3}$. Movements are slower when the curvature is higher
