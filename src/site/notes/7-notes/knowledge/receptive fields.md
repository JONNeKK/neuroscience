# receptive fields
A region of the sensory surface that causes a response in a specific neuron when stimulated (For what stimuli is which neuron active?). Basically multiple receptive stimuli converge onto fewer neurons.
### stimulus encoding with receptive fields
- Smaller (less receptive stimuli converge to equal amount of neurons) receptive fields make the localization more precise, stimuli can be separated better. 
- Increased sensor density allows for better localization, even though multiple receptors are active, processing of receptive populations allows better separation
- lateral inhibition: When a neuron is strongly activated it inhibits neurons next to it. This happens in the centre of receptive fields, so that the stimuli is sharper



# Flashcards
What is a receptive field? :: A region of the sensory surface that causes a response in a specific neuron when stimulated.
How can stimulus encoding be improved with receptive fields? :: smaller fields → better separation, increased density → better separation after processing of multiple fields, lateral inhibition → sharper peaks
