# blood pressure and electrolyte composition

regulated by a [[7-notes/knowledge/(para)sympathetic division#sympathetic division\|(para)sympathetic division#sympathetic division]] feedback loop between the ANS and pressure sensors.

##### what it involves
- osmolality of the blood is sensed by osmoreceptors (osmotic pressure control across semi-permeable membranes) → might trigger drinking
- vasopressing is released in the pituitary to decrease urinary output
- control of the blood volume
- arterial pressure detected by baroreceptors. When too high, drinking is suppressed


# energy balance
idk, here's a nice image of that

The explanations don't make more sense...well maybe a bit...but way too complicaated

### gastric stimulators
How to regulate the energy balance externally
###### Why?
- activate stomach motility to treat stomach paresis
- make obese people eat less
- monitor and regulate eating for diabetic people

###### How?
- recording neuronal activity, but that's optional
- artificially create the feeling of a full stomach to eat less by electrical stimulation


# breathing
Within the medulla, rhythmic breathing is generated. Over phrenic nerves the signals are transmitted to the diaphragm. Firing happens in bursts, which causes contraction of the diaphragm



# Flashcards
What are the four main components of homeostatic control of blood pressure and electrolyte composition? :: osmolality of the blood is sensed by osmoreceptors (osmotic pressure control across semi-permeable membranes) → might trigger drinking - vasopressing is released in the pituitary to decrease urinary output - control of the blood volume - arterial pressure detected by baroreceptors. When too high, drinking is suppressed
