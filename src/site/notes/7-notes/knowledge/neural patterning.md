The differentiation of the nervous system into different specialized areas is done by patterning mechanisms, providing the information by which this is achieved. 
# signalling
This is similar to [[7-notes/knowledge/neural induction\|neural induction]], however the presence of one diffusable signal can induce more than one neural fate. This depends on how much signal there is. When the signal (mostly morphogens) are produced in one site (the neuroectoderm = signalling source = organizer) they are more present there than elsewhere and form a gradient outwards:

fig1: The french are everywhere. Each colour represents a different neural fate. which depends on the distance to the organizer. 
###### time-dependence
To further complicate things, a cell might respond differently to the same gradient at different time-points or when the cell already experienced different gradients beforehand. See more: The Irish flag in neural development or context-dependence.
###### progression
The time-dependence allows for intricate interplay of gradients and a progressive patterning. That means that first broad domains can be defined and each area the subdivides further. The broad domains form either completely different structures of the [[7-notes/knowledge/central nervous system\|CNS]] or are just divided into equal sub-units.
This segmentation makes for easier development. Determining all neural fates at once is difficult but subdividing them further and further allows for applying blueprints to each segment.
# axis
The patterning begins in a very early stage of [[7-notes/knowledge/neurulation\|neurulation]], when the neural tissue is just a two-dimensional sheet of cells. The gradient system therefore is working at right angles to each other:
- AP-axis: anteroposterior
- DV-axis: dorsoventral / ML-axis: mediolateral
Each cell looks at the respective gradient and the right genes are expressed.
# Patterning the AP-axis
This happens differently in different animals.
### global organization
Wnt signalling affects this patterning greatly. This Wnt signalling can be inhibited by frzb. When there is an overexpression of frzb-mRNA, this causes formation of anterior-dorsal structures. Due to an AP-gradient of the overexpressed frzb-mRNA, cells along this axis develop to be part of different regions.

FB = forebrain; MB = midbrain; HB = hindbrain; SC = spinal cord

### regional organization
For the different specified regions in the vertebrate CNS there are different important organizers:

Each organizer is a boundary where on each side different genes are expressed. 
Important stuff:
- [[7-notes/knowledge/midbrain-hindbrain boundary organizer (MHB)\|midbrain-hindbrain boundary organizer (MHB)]]
- [[7-notes/knowledge/Segmentation of the Rhombenecephalon\|Segmentation of the Rhombenecephalon]]
- [[7-notes/knowledge/retinoic acid signalling\|retinoic acid signalling]]
### organizing orchestra
When all organizers organize at the same time (which they obviously do), the result is complicated. But they establish the molecular regionalization of the neural plate.
# DV patterning
It is not really touched in the lecture?



# Flashcards
How is signalling used in neural patterning? :: Mostly done by gradients of TFs, resulting in different cell types for different amounts of TFs
What is neural patterning? :: The process of differentiation of neural cells
What is the French and Irish flag in neural patterning? :: French: the locational different fates from cells in a TF-gradient. Irish: the timely different fates from exposure to different gradients.
What is Wnt-signalling? :: The amount of Wnt exposure of cell population differentiates them into the four main CNS-regions. This can be inhibited by frzb and therefore forms a gradient
What are the four main CNS-regions in global neural patterning :: forebrain, midbrain, hindbrain, spinal cord
What axis are there in neural patterning? AP: anterior-posterior; DV: dorsal-ventral or ML: medio-lateral.
How is the regional differentiation of neural cells happening? :: For different specialized regions there are different regional organizers.
What are important regional organizers? :: Zona limitans (intrathalamica) (ZLI); Anterior neural border (ANB); Midbrain-hindbrain boundary (MHB)
