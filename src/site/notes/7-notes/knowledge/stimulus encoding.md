There is a fundamental difference between external stimuli and how they are encoded in our brain. Therefore all stimuli have to be encoded as a representation.
An adequate stimulus is the type, that requires the least energy to represent such an encoding and procure a sensation.
The somatosensory system converts mechanical, thermal and painful stimuli to action potentials. The first stimuli is received by receptors and then converge onto other neurons.

To correctly represent such a stimuli, four types of information are important:
### stimulus modality
See also [[theory of labeled lines\|theory of labeled lines]].
polymodal receptors encode modality via temporal patterns of signals.
### stimulus location
See also [[theory of labeled lines\|theory of labeled lines]].
Topographic projections/sensory maps: What stimuli are next to each other are also encoded next to each other as in [[7-notes/knowledge/receptive fields\|receptive fields]].
### stimulus intensity: 
Changes in action potential frequency and timing. 
- stronger stimuli → higher frequency
- only definitely true for first processing stages
###### dynamic range
The intensity range over which a receptor exhibits a response. The lower bound is called the threshold, the upper bound saturation. 
- threshold: weakest stimulus that produces a response in 50% of the time
- saturation: stronger stimuli yield the same response
![stimulus encoding_dynamic range.png](/img/user/7-notes/knowledge/images/stimulus%20encoding_dynamic%20range.png)
When increasing the dynamic range, small changes in stimulus intensity yield small changes in neural activity (less saturation). Smaller dynamic range and small changes in stimulus intensity → large changes in neural activity (good onset detection/ sensory detection)
###### optimization
There is a trade-off between dynamic range and discrimination. 
- This can be circumvented by using groups of receptors that work together with smaller, but differentiated dynamic range. The dynamic range is therefore fractionated.
- logarithmic coding allows for a wide dynamic range but poor discrimination at high stimulus intensities
###### Weber's law
Actually not discovered by Weber but by his student Fechner.
$$
k = \frac{\Delta R}{R}.
$$
The minimal difference between two stimuli. 
- weight: ~2% in weight
- tactile: ~3% in pressure
- vision: 1-2% brightness increase
- taste: 10-20% concentration increase
→ fails at low intensities and with noise
### stimulus duration:
There are two classes of receptors:
- phasic receptors: produces [[7-notes/knowledge/action potential\|APs]] only when there is a change in stimulus
- tonic receptors: produces APs as long as the stimulus continues, but frequency decreases when stimulus is maintained for long periods
→ There are combinations of those

# Flashcards
What are the four types of information a stimulus presents? :: duration, intensity, location and modality
What is an adequate response? :: the type, that requires the least energy to represent such an encoding and procure a sensation
How is stimulus modality encoded? :: polymodal receptors encode modality via temporal patterns of signals and theory of labeled lines
How is stimulus location encoded? :: Topographic projections/sensory maps and theory of labeled lines
How is stimulus intensity encoded? :: Changes in action potential frequency and timing. 
How is stimulus duration encoded? :: Either through changes in stimulus or maintaining APs frequency during the stimulus period
What is the dynamic range? :: The intensity range over which a receptor exhibits a response.
What are the boundaries of the dynamic range? :: lower bound: threshold, higher bound: saturation
How can the threshold of the dynamic range be defined? :: The weakest stimuli that is at least 50% of the time detected
How is saturation of the dynamic range defined? :: When greater stimuli produce equal responses
What trade-off is there when looking at dynamic ranges? :: between dynamic range and discrimination
How can intensity encoding be optimized? :: fractionazing or logarithmic coding.
What is fractionazing the dynamic range? :: Using multiple receptor neurons with different dynamic ranges and combining their outputs
What is logarithmic coding? :: Instead of a linear dynamic range, it is logarithmic
What problems arise with logarithmic coding? :: The differentiation at higher stimuli is decreased
