The expression of genes is described molecularly in profiles of mRNA (or proteins). Each profile correlates with some morphology and physiology.

# How do different cells arise?
First look at [[7-notes/knowledge/gene structure\|gene structure]].
Textbook: Different transcription factors(proteins) are expressed in different cells and therefore drive different overall expression with other enhancers. 
My version: The idea is that if we have different transcription proteins in a cell, different parts of the DNA are transcribed, forming different new proteins. However a problem is that transcription proteins also have to be transcribed. So how is that different in different cell types? This is not clearly answered in the lecture. For further info: here's a link: [Morphogenesis - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphogenesis).

So different transcription factors(proteins)(TF) drives the expression of a gene after binding an enhancer. The same gene can be activated by different TFs and enhancers. Therefore there is a combinatorial possibility space for different cell types. 

The TFs recruit the RNA Polymerase II (RNA pol II (IMPORTANT)) to drive transcription.

# human interference
Of course humans try to analyze and manipulate the process of transcription. Either by inserting or generating fluorescent proteins into the cell by inserting plasmids (small artificial pieces of DNA) that repress/express certain specific protein transcription.
