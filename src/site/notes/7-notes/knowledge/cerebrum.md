Two cerebral hemispheres separated by the longitudinal (cerebral) fissure. Each hemisphere represents the other side of the body (in movement, vision, hearing, touch, ...). Most brain functions are lateralized â†’ meaning it's only represented in one hemisphere (like language on the left.)

The cerebrum contains roughly 19% of all [[7-notes/knowledge/neuron\|neuron]]s.

# fine structure
The left hemisphere controls verbal activities, the right hemisphere controls nonverbal abilities (like music and maths, etc...). The hemispheres are divided into four lobes each and connected by a channel called the corpus callosum:
- frontal lobe: front half
	- Frontal association area
	- speech production
	- mortor cortex
- parietal lobe: middle half
	- somatosensory cortec
	- speech understanding
	- taste
	- reading
	- somatosensory association area
- temporal lobe: side half
	- smell
	- hearing
	- auditory association area
- occipital lobe: back eight
	- vision
	- visual association area
There are three categories of regions:
- primary sensory areas with input via the [[thalamus\|thalamus]]
- [[7-notes/knowledge/different cortices\|different cortices]] with axons projecting down to motor neurons in the brainstem and spinal cord.
- association areas: Input from sensory areas and lower parts of the brain. Involved in perception and decision-making.


All of them have kinda the same material involved:

A gyrus is a convolution (Faltung), sulcus a furrow (Furche)


# functions
The cerebrum control all voluntary action

- movement
- sensory processing (vision, hearing, touch, smell, taste)
- language and communication
- learning and memory

Formulated differently as key roles:
- memory
- attention
- perceptual awareness
- thought
- controlling emotions
- hearing
- vision
- personality



# Flashcards
What are the four functions of the cerebrum? :: movement - sensory processing - language and communication - learning and memory
How is the cerebrum structured on a large scale? :: Two cerebral hemispheres separated by the longitudinal (cerebral) fissure.
