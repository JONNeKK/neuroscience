###### What they are
- Lipid protein molecules (hydrophobic from the inside) which span the [[membrane\|membrane]] and form pores or gates through which ions can pass
- They can open and close to control the movement of ions through the channel
- only specific ions (anions or cations) pass through a specific channel (e.g. sodium or potassium)

###### patch clamp recording
Basically isolating with a gigaohm seal one ion channel with a pipette and recording the current passing through. This can be changed by changing the voltage across the patch of membrane.
â†’ There are ion channel transitions that occur between open and closed states (basically instantaneous). The time a channel is open are seemingly random and it is possible to have open states with more than one current level
Can be approximated by an [[Markov model\|Markov model]]


###### modes of channel activation
Either by physical changes in the membrane or by attaching [[7-notes/knowledge/ligand\|ligand]]. The latter can happen on both sides of the membrane. Physical changes can be for instance stretching of the membrane (e.g. in mechanoreceptors in the skin) or voltage-activation (e.g. voltage-sensitive sodium channels, important for the rising phase of [[7-notes/knowledge/action potential\|APs]]). This classification is not rigid and multiple activation modes can exist for the same channel.


###### effect of membrane potential on channel current
![ion channel_ohmic.png](/img/user/7-notes/knowledge/images/ion%20channel_ohmic.png)
Looking at a potassium channel with equal concentration of potassium on both sides of the channel we recognize a linear (or 'ohmic') dependence between channel current (I) and [[7-notes/knowledge/membrane potential\|membrane potential]] as voltage (V):
$$
I=gV.
$$
$g$ is the channel conductance (a characteristic), measured in Siemens \[S=A/V]. It depends on two main factors:
- channel permeability
- concentration of ions in the region of the channel

Changing the balance of ion concentration on both sides makes a significant difference:

The dependence is no longer ohmic and has an [[7-notes/knowledge/equilibrium potential\|equilibrium potential]]. Approximating the relationship between current $I_\text{K}$, channel conductance $g_\text{K}$, membrane potential $V_\text{m}$ and equilibrium potential $E_\text{K}$ as linear near the equilibrium potential:
$$
I_{\text{K}}= g_{\text{K}}(V_{\text{m}}-E_{\text{K}}).
$$
