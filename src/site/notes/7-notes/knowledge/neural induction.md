The process of other cells influencing a cell via inter-cellular signalling to become a certain cell type (e.g. [[7-notes/knowledge/neuron\|neuron]]s) during development.

# mechanism of neural induction
In the case of neurons there is a protein (BMP4 = bone morphogenetic protein 4), that changes the cell fate from neurons to epidermic cells (skin cells). Therefore BMP inhibiting signalling molecules (e.g. Chording, Noggin, Follistatin) are necessary to create cells with neuronal fate.

The gastrula organizer (located on the dorsal lip of the animal cap) mediates neural induction, producing the BMP inhibitors, which 'cascade' through the cells.
In a newer model, there is a combination of the suppresion of BMP signalling and an additional FGF signalling:
This induces development of ERK dependent Zic3 transcription factors (proteins), which in turn determine the neuronal cell fate.

So there are two pathways for cells that have the possibility to become neural cells.
- They become epidermic cells through BMP4. This can be inhibited.
- They become neural cells. Which can be induced by FGF signalling


The end product is a neural plate in the embryo
