There are many different cell types (distinct physiology, morphology, and
a distinct gene expression profile), but all have the same RNA. The key question is how are those types determined? The key answer is [[7-notes/knowledge/gene regulation\|gene regulation]].
It is important to know the [[7-notes/knowledge/gene structure\|gene structure]] and conversion to actual, useful proteins, so read the second page first :)
