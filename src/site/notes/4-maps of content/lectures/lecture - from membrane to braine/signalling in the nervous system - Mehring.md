###### main messages (massively simplified)
- The membrane potential is a consequence of an ion imbalance on both sides of a selectively permeable membrane.
- The properties of an action potential result from the dynamics and voltage-dependance of ion channels.
- (Chemical) synapses transmit electric potentials from the pre- to the postsynapse by triggering a gating mechanism of specialized ion channels in the postsynaptic membrane.
