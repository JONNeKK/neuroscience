When an axon of cell A is near enough to
excite cell B and repeatedly or persistently
takes part in firing it, some growth process or
metabolic changes take place in one or both
cells such that A’s efficiency as one of the cells
firing B, is increased.              * - Donald Hebb, 'The Organization of Behavior’*
