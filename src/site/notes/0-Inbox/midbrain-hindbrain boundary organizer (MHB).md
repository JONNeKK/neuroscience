On the anterior side Otx2 is produced, which is critical to anterior brain formation. When this is missing, the entire fore- and midbrain are missing. On the posterior side Gbx2 is prevalent.
Rotating (changing anterior/posterior sides) the MHB organizer induces an additional organizer. This reveals that the effect of the boundary is two-sided.
###### Functions of the MHB
- midbrain patterning by increased expression of Otx2
- anterior hindbrain patterning by increased expression of Gbx2
- control of neuronal differentiation (= divided stem cells get a fate)
- control of proliferation (=further division of stem cells)
- morphogenesis (= the generation of form)
- ...
- establishes polarity in the Tectum
- axon guidance of the retinotectal projection

Note: MHB also works in the DV-axis.


# Flashcards
What transcription factors are on each side of the MHB? :: anterior: Oxt2; posterior: Gbx2
What happens when Oxt2 is missing near the MHB? :: The entire fore- and midbrain are missing
What happens when the MHB is rotated? :: An additional organizer is introduced.
What are the main functions of the MHB? :: midbrain patterning - hindbrain patterning - control of neuronal differentiation and proliferation - morphogenesis
On which axis does the MHB work? :: On bot AP and DV-axis
