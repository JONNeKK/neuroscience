The central nervous system is the main part of the nervous system. It consists of the brain and the spinal cord.

# The brain
It is protected by the scull and covered by meninges (3 membranes). The blood-brain barrier separates it from the body blood-flow. The brain is embedded in (cerebrospinal) fluid. 
The actual brain is composed of [[0-Inbox/neuron\|neuron]]s, [[0-Inbox/glia cell\|glia cell]]s and blood vessels.

There are different structural parts:
[[0-Inbox/cerebrum\|cerebrum]]
[[diencephalon\|diencephalon]]
[[midbrain\|midbrain]]
[[medulla oblongata\|medulla oblongata]]
[[cerebellum\|cerebellum]]
### grey and white matter
- grey matter contains mostly neuronal cell bodies (e.g. six-layered isocortex)
- white matter are the myelinated axons
