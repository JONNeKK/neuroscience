###### Abbreviated: AP

- a brief electrical pulse (~$1-2ms$) with large amplitude ($70-110mV$)
- all-or-nothing event
- can propagate rapidly ( $10^{2}\frac{m}{s}$) over long distances
- refractory period: a few milliseconds after an AP
- regenerative, fixed amplitude and duration
- $\Rightarrow$ in contrast to [[0-Inbox/local graded potential\|local graded potentials]] the amplitude and duration of an AP is not determined by the amplitude and duration of the stimulus
- However the amount of APs is higher for a higher membrane potential
