There are two types of recording:
![neuronal recording_schema.png](/img/user/7-notes/knowledge/images/neuronal%20recording_schema.png)
###### extracellular
using microelectrods (e.g. metal or glass capillaries with salt solution for conductivity purposes) with tip diameters in the tens of $\micro m$. recording of [[0-Inbox/action potential\|APs]]. It is established for recording in behaving animals.
###### intracellular
using glass capillaries with ionic solution and wires, both for conductivity. The tip measures ~0.1$\micro m$ in diameter and it is used for recording of membrane potential

Additionally one can record single [[0-Inbox/ion channel\|ion channel]]
