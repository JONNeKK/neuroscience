# What it does
- contributes to cognitive processing and movement generation
- Selection, initiation, suppression and execution of actions, as well as approvement  or rejection of motor cortex signals → filtering function
- Reinforcement learning - choosing good, avoiding bad things, habbit learning…
- Impaired basal ganglia function has strong consequences for behavior (Parkinson’s disease, drug addiction, Tourette syndrome,…)

- There is a strong convergence in terms of numbers of neurons in input and output structures
- Strong evolutionary conservation – all vertebrates have basal ganglia → it must be important!!1
- Everything here is a loop
# The different structural parts:
- [[Striatum\|Striatum]]
- [[globus pallidus\|globus pallidus]]
- [[subthalamic nucleus\|subthalamic nucleus]]
- [[substantia nigra\|substantia nigra]]
→ I might expand those further but I don't think their details are too important for the exam.
# The only important image:

Normally there is an interplay between Go and NoGo. One action is selected, while the others are suppressed.
# Dysfunction
- Parkinson Disease: Death of dopamine cells from SNc → STN hyperactivity → biased behaviour towards NoGo → symptoms: bradykineasia (slowness of movement), Akinesia (loss or impairment of voluntary movement), Tremor, Rigidity (stiffnesss)
- Hemiballism: STN hypoactivity (no activity)
- Huntington: cell death in striatum; progression to other brain areas, inherited



# Flashcards
What are the different structural parts of basal ganglia? :: Striatum - globus pallidus - subthalamic nucleus - substantia nigra
Draw the GO-circuit in basal ganglia with +/- signs and thin and thick arrows :: look it up
Draw the No GO-circuit in basal ganglia with +/- signs and thin and thick arrows :: look it up
Draw the STOP-circuit in basal ganglia with +/- signs and thin and thick arrows :: look it up
What are the main functions of basal ganglia? :: movement generation (selection, initiation, suppression and execution (as well as approve and reject motor commands)) - decision making/learning (evaluating risk/reward, forming habits/planning tasks/learning through emotions and motivation) - reward and addiction (because of reinforcement learning)
Where does dopamine play a role in basal ganglia? :: In substantia nigra pars compacta
What dopamine receptor families goes to which neural circuit in basal ganglia
