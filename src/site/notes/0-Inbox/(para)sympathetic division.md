The divisions are both part of the [[0-Inbox/autonomic nervous system\|autonomic nervous system]] and control basic unconscious tasks. The sympathetic division is for 'fight or flight', while the parasympathetic division stimulates the body to 'feed and breed' and then to 'rest and digest'. Whilst the sympathetic division is mostly reached from the spinal cord, the parasympathetic division starts higher in the brain-stem. However both don't sit inside the spinal cord/lowerbrain, but describe the outgoing nerve pathways from there. It basically forms a net around the spinal cord. Looks different in across individuals.

Before a signal reaches the effector cells on the organ where it is supposed to go, it passes through an intermediate node (ganglion). This is the (para)sympathetic ganglia sympathetic division.

We have a signal nerve chain from e.g. the control centre to efferent neurons. The final part consists of pre- and postganglionic neurons in each division.

# sympathetic division
###### nerve pathways
PRE-ganglionic: thoracic and lumbar spinal cord
POST-ganglionic: mostly in the sympathetic chain ganglions â†’ not directly going to the effector cells (although some are closer to organs)
POST-ganglionic transmitter: noradrenaline = norepinephrine

# parasympathetic division
###### nerve pathways
PRE-ganglionic: brainstem, upper thorax, sacral spinal cord
POST-ganglionic: sit closer to their effector organs
POST-ganglionic transmitter: acetylcholine (Ach)





### Flashcards
What is the function of the sympathetic division? :: fight or flight
What is the function of the parasympathetic division? :: 'feed and breed' and then to 'rest and digest'
Where does the sympathetic division start? :: near the vertebra
What are the constituents of the final part of the (para)sympathetic pathway? :: pre- and post-ganglionic cells
sympathetic pre-ganglionic pathway :: thoracic and lumbar spinal cord
sympathetic post-ganglionic pathway :: mostly in the sympathetic chain ganglions (some are closer to organs)
sympathetic post-ganglionic transmitter :: noradrenaline = norepinephrine
parasympathetic pre-ganglionic pathway :: brainstem, upper thorax, sacral spinal cord
parasympathetic post-ganglionic pathway :: sit closer to their effector organs
parasympathetic post-ganglionic transmitter ::acetylcholine (Ach)
