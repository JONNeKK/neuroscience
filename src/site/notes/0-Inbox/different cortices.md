All primary cortices and areas have different cytoarchitectonics, meaning different internal structures. Those are known as Brodmann Areas. The dude assigned each structural area a number and kinda guessed what does what. This isn't relevant anymore (I would say).
# primary motor cortex (M1)

Located in the dorsal portion of the frontal lobe (aca right in the middle from a top down view) (aca precentral gyrus).
### Function
generates neural impulses that pass down through the corticospinal tract to the motor neurons to execute movement.
### The corticospinal tract 
It connects the primary motor cortex with motor neurons of the brain stem and spinal cord. 90% of them go to the other side of the body(left-right).
### Broca's area
The motor area for speech on the dominant cerebral hemisphere (left mostly) Can be damaged by an expressive aphasia


# primary sensory cortex (S1)
Located dorsally behind the primary motor cortex in the parietal lobe (aca postcentral gyrus)
### Function
It receives and processes afferent somatosensory (external stuff such as: touch, pressure, pain, position, vibration, temperature) and proprioceptive (sense of self-movement and body position) input. It is relayed vis the [[thalamus\|thalamus]].
### Wernicke's area
A sensory area important for the comprehension of language.


## Somatotopy
point-for-point correspondence of an area of the body to a specific point
on the central nervous system. In the case of primary cortex:

# primary visual cortex (V1)
Located in the occipital lobe.
### Function
It receives, integrates, and processes visual information relayed from the retinae.


# Prefrontal cortex
Located frontal in the frontal lobe.
### Function
Contributes to a variety of executive functions - Decision
making, working memory, planning, motivation, impulse control, speech.


# Neocortex
Another word for cerebral cortex containing most of the above mentioned cortices. But it only refers to the grey matter ([[0-Inbox/central nervous system#grey and white matter\|central nervous system#grey and white matter]]) in each.
It is divided into six layers. Those are connected via distinct columns, acting as a single computational unit:
- Layer I: contains few cell bodies but has many processes
- Layer II/III: contains small/medium sized neurons and does intercortical connections
- Layer IV: contains the main afferent input from the [[thalamus\|thalamus]]
- Layer V: contains large pyramidal cells which project to the outside of the neocortex
- Layer VI: contains intercortical and thalamic projections



# Flashcards
Where is M1 located? :: M1 (primary motor cortex) is located in the dorsal portion of the frontal lobe
Where is S1 located? :: S1 (primary sensory cortex) is located frontal in the parietal lobe
What is the function of M1? :: M1 (primary motor cortex) generates neural impulses that control motor neurons
What is the function of S1? :: S1 (primary sensory cortex) receives and processes afferent somatosensory and proprioceptive input
What is somatosensory input into S1? :: external stuff such as: touch, pressure, pain, position, vibration, temperature
What is proprioceptive input into S1? :: sense of self-movement and body position
What is the coritcospinal tract? ::: What connects M1 with motor neurons in the brain stem and spinal cord?
What is somatotopy? :: point-for-point correspondence of an area of the body to a specific point on the central nervous system.
Where is V1 located? :: V1 (primary visual cortex) is located in the occipital lobe
What is the function of V1? :: V1 (primary visual cortex) receives and integrates visual input
Where is the prefrontal cortex located? :: Located frontal in the frontal lobe
What is the function of the prefrontal cortex? :: Contributes to a variety of executive functions - Decision making, working memory, planning, motivation, impulse control, speech.
What is Wernicke's area? :: A sensory area important for the comprehension of language.
What is Broca's area? :: The motor area for speech on the dominant cerebral hemisphere
What is the neocortex? :: The grey matter of each cortex
How is the neocortex structured? :: It contains six distinct layers connected by columns. Each column is a individual computational unit.
What is Layer I? ::: What contains few cell bodies but has many processes
What is Layer II/III? ::: What contains small/medium sized neurons and does intercortical connections
What is Layer IV? ::: What contains the main afferent input from the [[thalamus\|thalamus]]
What is Layer V? ::: What contains large pyramidal cells which project to the outside of the neocortex
What is Layer VI? ::: What contains intercortical and thalamic projections
