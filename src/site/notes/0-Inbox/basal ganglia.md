# What it does
- contributes to cognitive processing and movement generation
- Selection, initiation, suppression and execution of actions
- Reinforcement learning - choosing good, avoiding bad things, habbit learning…
- Impaired basal ganglia function has strong consequences for behavior (Parkinson’s disease, drug addiction, Tourette syndrome,…)

- There is a strong convergence in terms of numbers of neurons in input and output structures
- Strong evolutionary conservation – all vertebrates have basal ganglia → it must be important!!1
- Everything here is a loop
# The different structural parts:
- [[Striatum\|Striatum]]
- [[globus pallidus\|globus pallidus]]
- [[subthalamic nucleus\|subthalamic nucleus]]
- [[substantia nigra\|substantia nigra]]

→ I might expand those further but I don't think their details are too important for the exam.
