$$
E_{K}= \frac{RT}{zF}\cdot \ln{\frac{[K^{+}]_{o}}{[K^{+}]_{i}}} = 58mV \cdot\log{\frac{[K^{+}]_{o}}{[K^{+}]_{i}}}.
$$
- $E_K$ is the [[0-Inbox/equilibrium potential\|equilibrium potential]] for K⁺
- $R$ is the gas constant
- $T$ is the absolute temperature in Kelvin
- $z$ is the ionic valence
- $F$ is the Faraday's constant
- $[K^{+}]_{o},[K^{+}]_{i}$ are the potassium ion concentrations outside, inside

The second part with 58mV is approximated for room temperature at 20°C. In the body this increases to 61mV.
