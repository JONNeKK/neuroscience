genes are basically DNA with different parts containing different information
# general structure

The gene consists mainly of two regions, that follow each other:
- exon: The coding stuff, that contains the information how to build proteins
- intron: The regulation stuff, regulating the transcription
Other important points of interest on the genome that are non-coding:
- Promoter: near the beginning of the gene, binding sites for RNA polymerase. Basically that is the starting point of transcription
- enhancer: near the beginning of the gene, but not necessarily there. increases or decreases the rate of transcription over large distances
- UTRs: flanking the coding sequences â†’ regulating initiation and termination

# gene expression

The DNA gets transcribed to RNA, then it gets spliced and finally translated:
###### transcription
the double stranded DNA gets transcribed to single stranded RNA. The RNA still includes exons and introns. This forms an immature transcript. The key protein, that performs transcription is RNA Pol II (important to know!). This protein binds to the DNA when a promoter is there and starts the transcription process. An enhancer region can then bind to a transcription factor/protein increasing the amount of transcription (no further detail in the lecture).

###### splicing
The introns are now longer needed and therefore discarded. The exons are ligared into a mature m(essenger)RNA. This mRNA is exported from the nucleus of the cell.

###### translation
In a final step, the mature mRNA is translated into a protein product.


In each step there are regulatory steps, that are needed for true end functionality:
- transcriptional regulation (due to e.g. transcritption factors and enhancers). This is most accessible in research.
- splicing reulation
- translational regulation
- protein folding regulation
- post-translational modification (e.g. phosphorylation)
