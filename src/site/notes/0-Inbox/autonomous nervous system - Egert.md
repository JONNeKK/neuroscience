### Flashcards
the test your knowledge questions, which I think lead further than the actual exam questions
###### 1
What are the major subdivisions of the peripheral nervous system? :: (para)sympathetic divisions and enteric division
What is a major difference between the transmission of the sensory-motor system compared to the ANS :: sensory-motor is voluntary, ANS not; sensory-motor is single-neuron pathway, ANS two-neuron pathway
What are major structural differences between the sympathetic (symANS) and the parasympathetic (psymANS) division? :: the function, pre-ganglionic start and fiber length(sym - short, psym - long), post-ganglionic end, post-ganglionic transmitter
What is 'segmental organization'? What does this have to do with dermatomes? :: division into segments (e.g. spinal cord). Each segment innervates specific regions (e.g. skinareas = dermatomes). Thus each segment corresponds to a dermatome. The latter might have referred pain
What is referred pain? :: pain originiating from one area is felt in another. This is because sensory fibers converge to the same pathway/segment and may overlap, especially between organs and dermatomes
Describe some functional differences between symANS and psymANS at the organ level :: Heart: symp - increases heart rate; parasymp - decreases heart rate, Lungs: symp - dilates bronchioles giving more air; parasymp - constricts bronchioles reducing air flow, Digestive system: symp - inhibits salivation and slows peristalsis; parasymp - stimulates that, always 'fight or flight' vs 'rest and digest'
If you had to run from a predator: Which changes in your body's activity would you want to adjust for optimal performance? Which ANS subsystem needs to be activated/inactivated to achieve the adjustments. :: increased heart rate, increased air inflow, decreased digestion, vasoconstriction in blood vessels, pupils dilating. Activation of the sympathetic subsystem
Once a target value is set, how would you take care that the proper heart rate is maintained? Would you want to keep it steady at a fixed rate? :: parasympathetic division decreases heart rate, promoting a slower and less forceful heartbeat. During rest a fixed rate is nice to have.

###### 2
What are the core functions of central homeostatic regulation? :: controlling blood pressure/electrolyte composition, energy metabolism, reproductive behaviour, body temperature, defensive behaviour and sleeping
Can you have more than one transmitter on the same synapse? :: Yes, e.g. Acetylcholine + VIP (Vasoactive intestinal peptide)
What is the difference between neurotransmission and neuromodulation? :: Transmission: how neurons communicate directly or to target cells across synapse; Modulation: communicating using substances over longer distances
How can you achieve selective control over a cells activity when the transmission is diffuse and widespread? :: co-release of transmitter (don't know if that's all)
What is the enteric nervous system and in what respect does it differ from the sym./parasym. ANS? :: The brain of the bowel, regulating gastrointestinal functions locally; it functions autonomously without input from the CNS


###### 3
Which parameters are "analyzed" in the regulation of the fluid volume in your body? Which sensors are involved? :: osmolality, blood pressure and blood volume
What would you do to stop someone from eating and how would this work mechanistically? :: Make them feel like they have a full stomach, by electrically stimulating the stomach, the ENS or a vagus nerve branch
Why do we need a central pattern generator to breathe but not to generate a heart rhythm? :: The heart has its own intrinsic pacemaker.Why do we need a central pattern generator to breathe but not to generate a
heart rhythm? *Why do we need a central pattern generator to breathe but not to generate a
