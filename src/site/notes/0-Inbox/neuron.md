### structure

There are four major parts in a neuron:
- [[0-Inbox/dendrite\|dendrite]]: mainly for input
- [[cell body\|cell body]]: partly responsible for integrating input (exception: sensory neuron)
- [[axon\|axon]]: conducting an [[0-Inbox/action potential\|action potential]] to the presynaptic terminal
- [[presynaptic terminal\|presynaptic terminal]]: output of the neuron; mostly [[0-Inbox/neurotransmitter\|neurotransmitter]], which result in a [[7-notes/knowledge/postsynaptic potential\|PSP]].
Information flows from the dendrites to the cell body to the axons and finally to the presynaptic terminal.

###### polarity

Neurons can be classified in different ways:
Depending on the number of processes originating from their cell body as uni-, bi- and multi-polar:

Basically how many dendrites and axons connect to the cell body.

Nerve cells can do [[0-Inbox/electrical signalling\|electrical signalling]]:

# Electrical Signalling

[[0-Inbox/membrane potential\|membrane potential]]: electrical potential difference between interior and exterior of a [[0-Inbox/neuron\|neuron]]. When the cell is at rest, it is called resting membrane potential. Typically the interior is about 65mV more negative than the exterior, therefore the resting membrane potential is -65mV. When the membrane potential decreases, we speak of hyper-polarization, when it increases it is called depolarization.

There exist two main classes of electrical signals: [[0-Inbox/local graded potential\|local graded potentials]] and [[0-Inbox/action potential\|action potentials]]:

![local graded potential_receptor potential.png](/img/user/7-notes/knowledge/images/local%20graded%20potential_receptor%20potential.png)
The muscle spindle converts the stretch into a local membrane potential, which travels into the trigger zone. A high enough amplitude as to reach this zone to trigger an [[0-Inbox/action potential\|action potential]].


The local graded potential is generated by extrinsic physical stimuli or by [[synapse\|synapses]].. Importantly the amplitude and duration depend on the stimuli and they only spread a short distance from the site of origin. Can be either hyper-polarizing or depolarizing and they depend on passive electrical properties.
![local graded potential_amplitude and duration.png](/img/user/7-notes/knowledge/images/local%20graded%20potential_amplitude%20and%20duration.png)
greater amplitude = higher depolarization
longer stimulus = longer depolarization

###### Abbreviated: AP

- a brief electrical pulse (~$1-2ms$) with large amplitude ($70-110mV$)
- all-or-nothing event
- can propagate rapidly ( $10^{2}\frac{m}{s}$) over long distances
- refractory period: a few milliseconds after an AP
- regenerative, fixed amplitude and duration
- $\Rightarrow$ in contrast to [[0-Inbox/local graded potential\|local graded potentials]] the amplitude and duration of an AP is not determined by the amplitude and duration of the stimulus
- However the amount of APs is higher for a higher membrane potential

## Potential Questions

- How is the membrane potential maintained?
- How is the action potential generated
- How is the AP propagating along the axon?
- How is information transmitted via the synapse?
- How is information received via the dendrites?

The activity of neurons can be recorded:

<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">




There are two types of recording:
![neuronal recording_schema.png](/img/user/7-notes/knowledge/images/neuronal%20recording_schema.png)
###### extracellular
using microelectrods (e.g. metal or glass capillaries with salt solution for conductivity purposes) with tip diameters in the tens of $\micro m$. recording of [[0-Inbox/action potential\|APs]]. It is established for recording in behaving animals.
###### intracellular
using glass capillaries with ionic solution and wires, both for conductivity. The tip measures ~0.1$\micro m$ in diameter and it is used for recording of membrane potential

Additionally one can record single [[0-Inbox/ion channel\|ion channel]]

A single neuron can be tuned to different stimuli: [[neuronal tuning\|neuronal tuning]].
