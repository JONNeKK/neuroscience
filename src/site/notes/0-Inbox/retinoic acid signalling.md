Retinoic acid (RA) is not a protein, but a small organic molecule related to vitamin A.
The synthesis involves the vitamin A (retinol) to be converted to retinal (retinaldehyde) by enzymes (retinol dehydrogenases (RDHs)). retinaldehyde is further converted to the interesting reinoic acid by retinaldehyde dehydrogenases (RALDHs).
So with RDHs and RALDHs, vitamin A is converted to retinoic acid.
# gradient 
Of course as always there is a gradient. This time during gastrulation (early embryo patterning). There is more of RALDH2, which synthesizes RA in the posterior part and CYP26A1 (which does something?) in the anterior part. This results in an RA-gradient:

# signal transduction pathway
When RA is near recipient cells they diffuse across the membran into the cytoplasma (=cell). There a receptor protein (RA receptor = RAR = Rock am Ring) binds and both of them translocate into the nucleus. Both can activate genes. They bind to RA response elements (RARE). 
### Why?
This regulates the expression of some Hox genes.
→ RAR is a transcription factor.
This changes over time since the RA-gradient changes over time and different Hox-genes are expressed in the different rhombomeres at different times.
### detection
In vivo detection of RA distribution can be done using a GFP transgene (gene for fluorescent protein with RARE elements). The RAR bind to the RARE and the fluorescent protein is expressed and can be detected.


# Flashcards
What is RA? :: retinoic acid, a molecule transducted from vitamin A
What is needed for retinoic acid transduction? :: RDHs and RALDHs
What proteins are needed where to form a retinoic acid-gradient? :: RALDH2 (posterior) and CYP26A1 (anterior)
Where is the retinoic acid-gradient located? :: in the hindbrain
What is the signal transduction pathway of retinoic acid? :: RA diffuses into the cytoplasma → binds to RA receptors (RAR) → Both translocate together into the nucleus and activate genes with RA response elements (RARE)
Why is retinoic acid needed? :: It is a transcription factor for Hox genes that differentiate rhombomeres
How is retinoic acid signalling detected? :: When RA binds to RAREs that are connected to GFP transgenes expressing fluorescent proteins
