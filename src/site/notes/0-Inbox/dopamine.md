# dopamine
dopamine is neuromodulatory and a neurotransmitter released on the presynaptic side. There exist severeal dopamine pathways in the brain with different functions:
- reward-motivated behaviour (mesolimbic pathway)
- cognitive control (mesocortical pathway)
- motor control (nigrostriatal pathway) → important for basal ganglia
- control of the release of hormones (tuberoinfundibular pathway)

Dopamine signals a reward prediction error ([[7-notes/knowledge/reinforcement learning\|reinforcement learning]]).
# dopamine receptors
There are different dopamine receptors (D1-D5), categorized into families (D1- and D2-family)
### D1-family
D1 and D5 receptors. This family activates adenylyl cyclase, increasing cAMP intracellularly. This increases neuronal excitability.
→ excitatory
### D2-family
D2, D3 and D4 receptors. This family inhibites formation of cAMP. This decreases neuronal excitatbility
→ inhibitory
