The autonomic nervous system (ANS) is a part of the peripheral nervous system with efferent [[0-Inbox/neuron\|neuron]]s.

Most body function that we don't consciously control, is controlled by the autonomic nervous system (ANS). However indirect conscious influence is possible.
- part of the peripheral nervous system + central control
- is autonomous (e.g. heart rate, digestion, respiration rate, salivation, perspiration, diameter of the pupils, micturition (urination), and sexual arousal)
- innervates/stimulates smooth muscles, the heart and glands=Drüsen
- mostly reflex based on external and internal stimuli/network activity

###### example functions and controls
- homeostasis (O$_2$-supply, blood pressure, energy supply, etc...) → everything that needs constant supervision and adjustment
- neuromodulatory arousal systems
- reward systems
- emotions (e.g. blood pressure under stress, hormone release)

###### structure
There are three main structures. The first two kinda work together, the third is just for digestion. control centres are the connection to the brain
- [[0-Inbox/(para)sympathetic division#sympathetic division\|(para)sympathetic division#sympathetic division]] → peripheral
- [[0-Inbox/(para)sympathetic division#parasympathetic division\|(para)sympathetic division#parasympathetic division]] → antagonist to the sympathetic division; also peripheral
- [[0-Inbox/enteric nervous system\|enteric nervous system]] → gastrointestinal system; that one is peripheral as well
- [[0-Inbox/control centres\|control centres]] → hypothalamus/brainstem of the [[central nervous system\|central nervous system]].

### Flashcards
What are the three main structures in the ANS located peripherally :: (para)sympathetic division and enteric division
What is the function of the enteric division? ::: What controls the gastrointestinal system? (digestion)
Where is the control centre of the ANS located? :: in the hypothalamus/brainstem of the CNS
What are four example functions and controls of the ANS? :: homeostasis (follow up: what is that?), neuromodulatory arousal system, reward system, emotions 
How does the ANS control emotions? :: blood pressure under stress, hormone release
How is the ANS incorporated into the body? :: in the peripheral nervous system with a central control
What are five examples of things controlled by ANS? :: heart rate, digestion, respiration rate, salivation, perspiration, diameter of the pupils, micturition (urination), and sexual arousal
Where do the ANS neurons innervate? :: smooth muscles, the heart and glands
How is the ANS activated? :: mostly reflex based (external or internal) or from network activity
What are three examples for homeostasis? :: O$_2$-supply, blood pressure, energy supply
