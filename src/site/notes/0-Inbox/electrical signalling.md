# Electrical Signalling

[[0-Inbox/membrane potential\|membrane potential]]: electrical potential difference between interior and exterior of a [[0-Inbox/neuron\|neuron]]. When the cell is at rest, it is called resting membrane potential. Typically the interior is about 65mV more negative than the exterior, therefore the resting membrane potential is -65mV. When the membrane potential decreases, we speak of hyper-polarization, when it increases it is called depolarization.

There exist two main classes of electrical signals: [[0-Inbox/local graded potential\|local graded potentials]] and [[0-Inbox/action potential\|action potentials]]:

The muscle spindle converts the stretch into a local membrane potential, which travels into the trigger zone. A high enough amplitude as to reach this zone to trigger an [[0-Inbox/action potential\|action potential]].


The local graded potential is generated by extrinsic physical stimuli or by [[synapse\|synapses]].. Importantly the amplitude and duration depend on the stimuli and they only spread a short distance from the site of origin. Can be either hyper-polarizing or depolarizing and they depend on passive electrical properties.

greater amplitude = higher depolarization
longer stimulus = longer depolarization

###### Abbreviated: AP

- a brief electrical pulse (~$1-2ms$) with large amplitude ($70-110mV$)
- all-or-nothing event
- can propagate rapidly ( $10^{2}\frac{m}{s}$) over long distances
- refractory period: a few milliseconds after an AP
- regenerative, fixed amplitude and duration
- $\Rightarrow$ in contrast to [[0-Inbox/local graded potential\|local graded potentials]] the amplitude and duration of an AP is not determined by the amplitude and duration of the stimulus
- However the amount of APs is higher for a higher membrane potential

## Potential Questions

- How is the membrane potential maintained?
- How is the action potential generated
- How is the AP propagating along the axon?
- How is information transmitted via the synapse?
- How is information received via the dendrites?
