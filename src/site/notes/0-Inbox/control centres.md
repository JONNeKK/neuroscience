### central autonomic network
There are control loops/reflex arcs that basically 'just happen' â†’ there is little voluntary interference

# role in the ANS
It's basically a remote control for the ANS. 
### general remarks for hormone release
In addition it controls glands (e.g. the pituitary gland). Direct control happens to the posterior pituitary for subsequent hormone (peptides vasopressin and oxytocin) release. The release into the blood alone is not good enough: The targeted organs are far away, the blood volume is large and tiny amounts of transmitter are released. Therefore a second indirect control is managed in the anterior pituitary. That is regulated by hormones secreted by neuroendocrine cells, which project to the median eminence. There released peptides travel through a portal system to the anterior pituitary, where the actual hormones are released. 

Basically it is an amplifier and can release more, but also more precise. (TODO what are secretory cells?)

### six vital functions
- controls blood pressure and electrolyte composition: 
	- regulates drinking behaviour (thirst) and salt appetite (electrolytes)
	- controls the constriction of blood vessels
	- controls the release of hormones
- energy metabolism (mainly food):
	- regulates eating behaviour (hunger)
	- controls digestion
	- controls the release of hormones (Glucocorticoids, growth hormone, thyroid-stimulating hormone)
- reproductive behaviour
	- autonomic modulation of the reproductive organs
	- endocrine regulation of the...(not listed)
- body temperature
	- influences behaviour to avoid warm or cold
	- controls body heat conservation
	- controls the release of hormones that influence metabolic rate
- defensive behaviour (fight or flight)
	- regulates stress response to environmental threats
- sleeping
	- regulates the sleep-wake cycle
	- also the levels of arousal when awake (wtf?)

# smooth muscle
used to apply pressure to vessels and organs. Mostly in sheets or strands of smooth muscle cells. The muscles contract when ATP is freed, which depends on external intensity of stimuli. This is a graded process, thus the name smooth operator.
The entire process is not voluntary and contraction is persistent.
Used for controlling of blood pressure and oxygen level. Also used in the digestive system to control the obvious.
gap junctions between the cells allow for signal transmission
###### inputs
- spontaneous electrical activity
- neurotransmitters released by autonomic neurons
- hormones
- local changes in the chemical composition
- stretches

Signals can 'cascade' through the connected cells as part of signal transmission. An example is swallowing, which stretches smooth muscles in a wave across the entire digestive system. This allows food to pass through it.

# transmitter interaction
Several neuronal transmitter systems can interact and even co-release. There are three common types of neurotransmitter used by the ANS:
- Acetylcholine
- Norepinephrine
- Acetylcholine + VIP (Vasoactive intestinal peptide)

# Flashcards
How are smooth muscles activated? :: spontaneous electrical activity - neurotransmitters released by autonomic neurons - hormones - local changes in the chemical composition - stretches
How are signals transmitted by smooth muscles :: through gap junctions or contractions
