The muscle spindle converts the stretch into a local membrane potential, which travels into the trigger zone. A high enough amplitude as to reach this zone to trigger an [[0-Inbox/action potential\|action potential]].


The local graded potential is generated by extrinsic physical stimuli or by [[synapse\|synapses]].. Importantly the amplitude and duration depend on the stimuli and they only spread a short distance from the site of origin. Can be either hyper-polarizing or depolarizing and they depend on passive electrical properties.

greater amplitude = higher depolarization
longer stimulus = longer depolarization
