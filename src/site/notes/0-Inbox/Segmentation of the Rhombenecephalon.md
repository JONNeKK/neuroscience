The rhomboencephalon (hindbrain) is functionally and morphologically organized in segments (rhombomeres (rhombonbons)). 
# general structural information
In the end each segment has distinct motor neurons that control different muscles in the head. How is this differentiation performed? I'm glad you asked:
It is actually not true segmentation (in the sense of reiterated segmental units). But a process of segmentation. The first sign is the appearance of eight swellings (called r1-r8) in the neural tube, shortly after closing. Odd- and even-numbered segments are different and motor axons only exit through even-numbered rhombomeres. 
# specification
1. activation of transcription factors in odd- or even-segment patterns. This is in response to initial AP-signalling (too complex for detailed explanation)
2. Each segment has an 'identity'. Basically what this segment is destined to become.
3. Then there are Hox genes. Theses are activated before the segmentation but are cross-regulated afterwards (each segment regulates neighbouring segments). These are regulated by the early posteriorizing signals (posterior-anterior gradient), see [[0-Inbox/retinoic acid signalling\|retinoic acid signalling]]

The neurons in each segment are kept separated by Eph-ephrin signalling. Cells in odd or even segments have different proteins, so they do not want to get in contact with each other. These molecules appear to be from the Eph-ephrin family.
# changes to the development
When mutating hox genes, the different segments can be transformed into each other.


# Flashcards
What is segmentation? :: process of dividing neural tissue into distinct regions, barely connected
How is rhombomere segmentation activated? :: through different TFs in odd- or even-segment patterns in response to initial AP-signalling
When are Hox-genes expressed in rhombomere segmentation? :: These are activated before segmentation and cross regulated
What role do Hox-genes play in rhombomere segmentation? :: Different Hox-genes express different proteins in different rhombomeres that further strengthen the distinction of segments
What happens when hox-genes are mutated? :: different rhombomere segments can be transformed into each other.
How are the neural populations in each rhombomere kept separated? :: Through molecules of the Eph-ephrin family that cells of different segments are repelled by each other
