This is basically how the [[0-Inbox/central nervous system\|CNS]] is formed during development. 
In a frog, this is done after the formation of the Blastula (A development stage of the embryo, it contains mainly the same kind of cells). The CNS forms from cells located on the dorsal side of the animal cap of the gastrula embryo (The stage after the Blastula):

The key question is: What tells these cells to become CNS?

# Flashcards
Where does the CNS form in a frog embryo? :: The CNS forms from cells located on the dorsal side of the animal cap of the gastrula embryo
###### problem sheet
Please explain the mechanism of neurulation! :: The formation of the neural tube out of the neural sheet. The sheet is pushed inwards and folds to form a tube underneath the epidermis. 
Does the neural anlage formed during neural induction have anterior or posterior CNS characteristics? :: Yes due to the fundamental asymmetry of the animal cap there is a difference. This is e.g. the formation of the neural tube as primary or secondary neurlation
What are the fundamentally different forms of neurulation? :: Primary: The folding of the neural plate to form a tube; Secondary: The hollowing of an initial solid rod of cells.
What is neural induction? :: The process of other cells influencing a cell via inter-cellular signalling to become a certain cell type. 
Which mechanisms mediate neural induction? :: The gastrula organizer induces BMP4 inhibiting proteins. Therefore fewer neural cells turn into epidermic cells. Another way is FGF signalling which induces the cells to become neural cells.

What is neurogenesis? :: The formation of neural cells within the neuroectoderm
