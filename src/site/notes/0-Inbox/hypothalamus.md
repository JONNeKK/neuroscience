Contains a number of nuclei, that have different functions. It regulates many metabolic processes and activities of the [[0-Inbox/autonomic nervous system\|autonomic nervous system]].

# role in the ANS
It's basically a remote control for the ANS. 
### general remarks for hormone release
In addition it controls glands (e.g. the pituitary gland). Direct control happens to the posterior pituitary for subsequent hormone (peptides vasopressin and oxytocin) release. The release into the blood alone is not good enough: The targeted organs are far away, the blood volume is large and tiny amounts of transmitter are released. Therefore a second indirect control is managed in the anterior pituitary. That is regulated by hormones secreted by neuroendocrine cells, which project to the median eminence. There released peptides travel through a portal system to the anterior pituitary, where the actual hormones are released. 

Basically it is an amplifier and can release more, but also more precise. (TODO what are secretory cells?)

### six vital functions
- controls blood pressure and electrolyte composition: 
	- regulates drinking behaviour (thirst) and salt appetite (electrolytes)
	- controls the constriction of blood vessels
	- controls the release of hormones
- energy metabolism (mainly food):
	- regulates eating behaviour (hunger)
	- controls digestion
	- controls the release of hormones (Glucocorticoids, growth hormone, thyroid-stimulating hormone)
- reproductive behaviour
	- autonomic modulation of the reproductive organs
	- endocrine regulation of the...(not listed)
- body temperature
	- influences behaviour to avoid warm or cold
	- controls body heat conservation
	- controls the release of hormones that influence metabolic rate
- defensive behaviour (fight or flight)
	- regulates stress response to environmental threats
- sleeping
	- regulates the sleep-wake cycle
	- also the levels of arousal when awake (wtf?)

# Flashcards
What are the six vital functions of the hypothalamus in ANS? :: controlling blood pressure/electrolyte composition, energy metabolism, reproductive behaviour, body temperature, defensive behaviour and sleeping
How does the hypothalamus control blood pressure and electrolyte composition? ::  regulates drinking behaviour (thirst) and salt appetite (electrolytes) - controls the constriction of blood vessels - controls the release of hormones
How does the hypothalamus control the energy metabolism? :: regulates eating behaviour (hunger) - controls digestion - controls the release of hormones (Glucocorticoids, growth hormone, thyroid-stimulating hormone)
How does the hypothalamus control the reproductive behaviour? :: autonomic modulation of the reproductive organs - endocrine regulation of the...(not listed)
How does the hypothalamus regulate the body temperature? :: influences behaviour to avoid warm or cold - controls body heat conservation - controls the release of hormones that influence metabolic rate
How does the hypothalamus control defensive behaviour? :: regulates stress response to environmental threats
How does the hypothalamus control sleeping? :: regulates the sleep-wake cycle - also the levels of arousal when awake
